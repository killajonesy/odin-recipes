Here is where I am supposed to say a few things.
I have learned (relearned, really) HTML boilerplate code and some basic command line commands.
Commits and things of that nature used to be second nature to me, but it's been a few years and I forget the fine details of command line commands.
Perhaps it's time I commit this sucker, eh?
