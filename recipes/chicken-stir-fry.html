    <h2>Chicken Stir-Fry with Vegetables</h2>
        <p>I usually do a chicken stir-fry for one of my weekly meals. Something about washing and cutting vegetales for this meal is relaxing. I tend to drink a pantload of coffee while prepping for this meal as it's early in my day and I really need the mental boost to get my carcass in gear.</p>

            <li>6 large chicken breasts, cubed</li>
