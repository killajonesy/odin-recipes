    <h2>Chicken Stir-Fry with Vegetables</h2>
        <p>I usually do a chicken stir-fry for one of my weekly meals. Something about washing and cutting vegetales for this meal is relaxing. I tend to drink a pantload of coffee while prepping for this meal as it's early in my day and I really need the mental boost to get my carcass in gear.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 large red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>22 medium button mushrooms</li>
            <li>6 stalks of celery</li>
            <li>3 cups of jasmine rice</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
